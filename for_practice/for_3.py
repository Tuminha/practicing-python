# For Loop Exercise 3: Nested For Loops and Complex Data Structures
# 
# Exercise: Use nested for loops to process complex data structures
# 1. Process a 2D list (matrix) using nested for loops
# 2. Compare nested for loops with your while loop matrix experience
# 3. Use for loops to process a list of dictionaries
# 4. Implement data aggregation and analysis patterns
# 5. Explore performance differences between for and while loops
# 
# This builds on for_2.py by adding:
# - Nested for loop patterns
# - Complex data structure processing
# - Dictionary iteration and manipulation
# - Data aggregation techniques
# - Performance considerations

# Complex data structures to work with

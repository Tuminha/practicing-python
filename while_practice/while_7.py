# Difficulty: ðŸ”´ (Advanced)
# While Loop Exercise 7: Nested Loops and Complex Data Processing
# 
# Exercise: Use nested while loops to find common elements between two lists
# and perform advanced analysis on the results
# 1. Use outer while loop to iterate through list_1
# 2. Use inner while loop to search for each element in list_2
# 3. When a common element is found, check if it meets additional criteria
# 4. Count and collect elements that are: common, even, and greater than 5
# 5. Calculate statistics on the filtered results
# 
# This builds on while_6.py by adding:
# - Nested while loops (loop inside a loop)
# - Complex multi-step data processing
# - Advanced filtering with multiple criteria
# - Statistical analysis of results

## 📚 Learning Path Overview

This repository contains my structured approach to learning Python programming concepts through progressive exercises. Each folder represents a different programming concept, starting with the fundamentals and building up to more advanced topics.

### 🗂️ Current Modules

| Module | Status | Difficulty | Description |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **while_practice** | ✅ Complete | 🟢🟢🟢 | While loop fundamentals and applications |
| **for_practice** | 🔄 Coming Soon | - | For loop mastery |
| **functions_practice** | 🔄 Coming Soon | - | Function definition and usage |
| **classes_practice** | 🔄 Coming Soon | - | Object-oriented programming |
| **algorithms_practice** | 🔄 Coming Soon | - | Data structures and algorithms |

## 🎯 While Loop Practice (`while_practice/`)

My first completed module! This folder contains 6 progressive exercises that taught me the fundamentals of while loops in Python.

### 📊 Exercise Progress

| Exercise | Difficulty | Status | Key Concepts |
|----------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `while_1.py` | 🟢 Beginner | ✅ Complete | Basic iteration, simple conditions |
| `while_2.py` | 🟢🟢 Easy | ✅ Complete | Counting, summing, running totals |
| `while_3.py` | 🟢🟢🟢 Easy-Intermediate | ✅ Complete | Finding extremes (max/min) |
| `while_4.py` | 🟡 Intermediate | ✅ Complete | Searching, early exit with `break` |
| `while_5.py` | 🟡🟡 Intermediate | ✅ Complete | Multiple conditions, modulo operator |
| `while_6.py` | 🟡🟡🟡 Intermediate-Advanced | ✅ Complete | List building, data filtering |

### 🎓 What I Learned
